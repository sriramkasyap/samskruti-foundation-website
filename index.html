                    <p>
                        Culture is the bedrock of any civilisation. The only
                        civilisation that stood the test of time is the
                        Saraswati ñ Sindhu civilisation of bhArat ñ i.e., India
                        - sustained all along by the indefatigable sanAtana
                        Hindu Dharma.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The spiritual underpinnings of the bhAratEya culture
                        directed all aspects of life of our society, reflected
                        through the four pillars of human existence: dharma
                        (ethics and values based conduct, existence), artha
                        (material and economic needs / goals of the mind and
                        body), kAma (fulfilment of wants and material enjoyment)
                        and mOksha (attainment of the Supreme Bliss). All
                        activities had their base in dharma with the attainment
                        of mOksha being the goal for the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the ages, this framework put this civilisation at
                        the forefront of global human development. World-class
                        universities were setup and gave refuge to learners from
                        world over. Trade and commerce flourished making bhArat
                        the powerhouse of global economic development (as
                        highlighted in the work of Angus Maddison on The World
                        Economy: A Millennial Perspective. Literature and arts
                        flourished. Happiness - within and without - abounded.
                        The society was at its zenith.

                    <p>
                        Things changed - for the worse - with time over the past
                        millennium and specifically so, over the past three
                        hundred years! The civilisation considerably weakened,
                        reduced in geography - and in all respects - to India.
                        This downslide cannot be allowed any further! Where
                        better to start, and what better to take inspiration
                        from, than the eons young bhAratEya samskRuti, to
                        rejuvenate the society and direct it towards the
                        pinnacle of glory!

                    <p>
                        Samskruti Foundation's vision is to accomplish the same.
